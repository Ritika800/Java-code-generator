Java-code-generator

This Java code generates a random password of a specified length.

1. The code starts by importing the necessary Java utilities package.
2. It declares a public class named "NewClass" and a main method within it.
3. In the main method, it initializes a variable "length" with the desired length of the password, which is 10 in this case.
4. It then calls the "hp_Password" method, passing the length as an argument, and prints the returned password.
5. The "hp_Password" method is declared as static, meaning it can be called without creating an object of the class.
6. Within the "hp_Password" method, the code first declares and initializes strings containing capital letters, small letters, numbers, and symbols.
7. It concatenates all these strings into a single string called "values".
8. It then creates an instance of the Random class named "rndm_method".
9. A character array called "password" is created with the specified length.
10. A loop is used to iterate over each index of the password array.
11. At each index, the code uses the "rndm_method" object to generate a random number within the range of the "values" string length using the "nextInt()" method.
12. The character at the random index of the "values" string is fetched using the "charAt()" method, and assigned to the current index of the "password" array.
13. Finally, the generated password array is returned.
